II. The attack surface
=======================

XSS attacks take place in the very intricated and convoluted environment of the Web. To grasp their mechanisms and capabilities requires a full understanding of the technology stack of this environment.

Global : so many potential targets.
-----------------------------------

more and more client-side, web apps
virtually everything has an http interface, or an http api -> browser is the most versatile tool !

ebooks, pdf, firefox os

###"Not only js" : 

    action script (flash)
        "abuse as to inject js"
        arguably js XSS anyway, just served through a flash file..
    coffescript, python, dart
        compiles to js
    dart
        maybe soon ?




Local : so many ways for a target to be vulnerable.
---------------------------------------------------
    
###multiple parsers

so many ways to execute js from html
more layers -> more complex semantic rules.

###js
so permissive !
