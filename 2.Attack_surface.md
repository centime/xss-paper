II. The attack surface
=======================

Global : so many potential targets.
-----------------------------------

###Rise of Web services.
    The web is expending.
    Internet of things is building itself around http
        -> virtually everything has an http interface

###Rise of client-side Web applications.
    which have a broader local attack surface (DOM-based XSS, js eval...)

###Javascript can be found in unexpected places, outside of the browser.
    
    Pdf reader[0]
    Android apps (WebView)[0], (WebView SOP UXSS)[1]
    Firefox OS user-space

###Javascript isn't the only client-side scripting langage.

    Action Script
        usually exploited into executing javascript
    coffescript, typescript, python, dart
        compile to js
    dart
        maybe soon it's own virtual machine ?

More langages means potentially more parsers susceptible to fail at some point. On the other hand, the new langages are designed with in mind the serious lacking of javascript, and should address them in a satisfying way.


Local : so many ways for a target to be vulnerable.
---------------------------------------------------

###multiple parsers
    dangerous chars for html =/= dangerous chars for js
    trick a js parser with html.
    worse, or better, when we add another langage one top of that ! (coffeescript =/= flash)

    "HTML entity encoding is okay for untrusted data that you put in the body of the HTML document, such as inside a <div> tag. It even sort of works for untrusted data that goes into attributes, particularly if you're religious about using quotes around your attributes. But HTML entity encoding doesn't work if you're putting untrusted data inside a <script> tag anywhere, or an event handler attribute like onmouseover, or inside CSS, or in a URL. So even if you use an HTML entity encoding method everywhere, you are still most likely vulnerable to XSS. You MUST use the escape syntax for the part of the HTML document you're putting untrusted data into."[2]

###So many entry points for js
    
    <script> tag
    html tag properties:
        onerror
        onload
        ...
    regarded as a "protocol" by browsers : href="javascript:alert(1)"
    advanced functionalities in JS frameworks (dual binding &co) : 
        sandboxed evaluation of user inputs
        ...you fool[0]...

###Javascript is crazy.
    
    // alert(1)
    []['\163\157\162\164']['\143\157\156\163\164\162\165\143\164\157\162']('\141\154\145\162\164(1)')()

    // AngularJS sept 2014 sandbox evasion[1]
    {{toString.constructor.prototype.toString=toString.constructor.prototype.call;}}['a','alert(1)'].sort(toString.constructor);
