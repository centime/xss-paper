II. The Web environment
=======================

XSSes take place in the very intricated and convoluted environment of the Web. To grasp their mechanisms and capabilities requires a full understanding of the technology stack of this environment.

The attack surface
------------------

###Global : many application use technologies prone to XSS.

more and more client-side, web apps
virtually everything has an http interface, or an http api -> browser is the most versatile tool !


####"Not only js" : 

    action script (flash)
        "abuse as to inject js"
        arguably js XSS anyway, just served through a flash file..
    coffescript, python, dart
        compiles to js
    dart
        maybe soon ?




###Local : for a given app, different techniques / technologies can be abused to gain XSS
    
####multiple parsers

so many ways to execute js from html
more layers -> more complex semantic rules.

####js
so permissive !


Different attack vectors
------------------------
            stored
                rest  api
            reflected
                mail
                corrupted content


Other relevant techs
--------------------

    cookies
    csrf-tokens
    CORS

    Evolving, and it doesn't look like it will stop evolving that fast anytime soon, with new protocols, designs
     (websockets), (CSP, WebRTC, XSS-filters...)
